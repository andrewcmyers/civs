See the file INSTALL for installation instructions. New releases of the
software are announced here and sent in email to the

CIVS users mailing list</a>.

<p>
There is also a 
<a href="https://github.com/andrewcmyers/civs">
a GitHub repo for CIVS</a> which is generally a bit ahead of the
latest release. Contributions via pull requests are welcome.

	<b>Note:</b> Another voting system, known as
	<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/civitas">
	Civitas</a>,
	is also under development at Cornell.
	This new system, described in a 
	<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/clarkson/papers/clarkson_civs_tr.pdf">technical report</a>,
	uses much more complex cryptographic protocols to provide universal verifability 
	and coercion resistance.  The new system is available for download,
	but it does not yet have a user interface.

	<li>Internationalization support including consistent use of UTF-8</li>
	<li>Localization for Hungarian, Italian, French, and German</li>

<li>2.11 (December 2008):
<ul>
<li>Elections are now called "polls" uniformly, per a user suggestion.</li>
<li>Results are now cached, which should improve server performance
a great deal for large polls.</li>
<li>Schulze/beatpath algorithm now uses "against" preferences in addition to
"for" preferences. It now tends to agree with CIVS RP more often, perhaps
because it no longer throws away information that CIVS RP uses.</li>
<li>All completion methods are now in a standardized form, which makes
it easy to add new completion methods. It requires writing a Perl package
that implements <code>rank_candidates</code> and <code>print_details</code>,
and modifying two tables at the top of the "results" script.</li>
<li>Some formatting cleanup of code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2.10 (August 2008):
<ul>
<li>Elections with write-ins now have voting initially disabled. It can
be enabled explicitly from the control page. This allows write-ins to
be on the same footing as other choices.</li>
<li>The election results page has a progress bar, which gives reassuring
feedback for the more expensive completion methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.9 (January 2008):
<ul>
<li>Added filtering of HTML tags to remove possible XSS attacks, etc. Most
useful HTML markup still permitted.</li>

<ul>
<li>Better checking of email addresses to prevent sending bogus emails.</li>
<li>Voter emails now come from CIVS administrator instead of election supervisor.</li>
<li>Cleaned-up completion algorithm code allows adding new completion
    algorithms more easily.</li>
<li>Corrected description of runoff.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2.7:
<ul>
<li>Ability to release election results only to a limited set of users.</li>
<li>Better client-side sanity checking at election creation.</li>
<li>Previewing of election description and choice list.</li>
<li>Another completion algorithm (runoff)</li>
<li>Better factoring out of completion algorithms to allow future
    algorithms to be added more easily.</li>
<li>Allow voters' identity to be revealed as an election option</li>
<li>Mail to voters is now HTML+ASCII (should be made optional) to help
    get through spam filters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
