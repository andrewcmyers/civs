<h2>Conditions of data release</h2>
<p>
Data from CIVS polls is released for research purposes only.
</p>

<h2>Privacy protections</h2>
<p>Released data is fully anonymized, with all identifying information other
than ballot rankings removed, including the title of the poll and the names of
the choices. In addition, ballots are shuffled in two ways. First, the order of
ballots is randomized, and the order of the choices is as well. Further, small
fraction of ballots (around 10%) are randomly dropped.  With more than 20,000
polls in the dataset, it is expected that it will be infeasible to reliably
identify past polls or the content of ballots cast in them.
</p>

<h2>Format</h2>
<p>
Data is released as a compressed file in JSON format. The contents are an array
of poll descriptions. The following attributes may be reported for each poll:
<dl>
<dt>election_id<dd>A pseudonymized identifier for the poll
<dt>mode<dd>Either "proportional" or "nonproportional". Most polls are the latter.
<dt>num_choices<dd>The number of choices/alternatives/candidates being ranked
<dt>test<dd>Either "yes" or "no" depending on whether this was a test poll. Test polls
   often use synthetic data, depending on how they were used.
<dt>ballots<dd> An array of ballots. Each ballot is an array containing the ranks of
   the choices, from 1 up to the number of choices. The rank may also be "?" if the
   voter did not express an opinion about the rank of that choice.
<dt>num_ballots<dd>The length of the ballot array
</dl>

</p>
