<h2>Download</h2>

<p>
Most users use the existing CIVS web server. However, the software is
available for installation elsewhere, subject to certain restrictions
described in the included README file.
</p>
<p>
The latest release of CIVS can be found in the  <a href="https://github.com/andrewcmyers/civs">CIVS GitHub repo</a>, which is
generally a bit ahead of the latest release. Contributions via pull requests
are welcome.
</p>
<p>
See the file INSTALL in the release for installation instructions. New releases of the
software are announced here and sent in email to the
<a href="https://lists.cs.cornell.edu/mailman/listinfo/civs-users-l">
CIVS users mailing list</a>.

	<b>Note:</b> Another voting system, known as
	<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/civitas">
	Civitas</a>, has also been developed at Cornell.
	This new system, described in a
	<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/clarkson/papers/clarkson_civs_tr.pdf">technical report</a>,
	uses much more complex cryptographic protocols to provide universal verifability
	and coercion resistance.  The new system is available for download,
	but it does not yet have a user interface.

    algorithms more easily.</li>

<li>Better client-side sanity checking at election creation.</li>
<li>Previewing of election description and choice list.</li>

    algorithms to be added more easily.</li>
<li>Allow voters' identity to be revealed as an election option</li>
<li>Mail to voters is now HTML+ASCII (should be made optional) to help
    get through spam filters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
